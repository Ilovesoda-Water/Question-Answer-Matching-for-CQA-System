p6
aS'When I was an UnderGrad I had the opportunity to travel to China  Before we left we got an overview of the language  Im amazed by any adult who can learn this language  To me its very complex with  standard inflections as opposed to the  standard in the English language  So technically you could say the same word with  different inflections and mean  different things  And thats just the speaking part  Pray that whenever you take your classes that the instructor doesnt make you learn the Characters'

p4
aS'It is my understanding that cancelling store credit cards does NOT hurt your score  In fact it can help because it can eliminate the amount of open credit that you havexaxaHowever I suppose at the extremes it could hurt  For instance if you have only one credit card and you cancel it then you may lose your ability to prove that you are a good credit risk until you get another credit cardxaxaBut if you have open credit cards with stores that you rarely use Id recommend cancelling them'

p1
(lp2
S'One of the basic features of language is that it changes over time as people speak it  Americans that came from England spoke like Englishmen of their particular class but then they became isolated from England and both groups of people had their language evolve but in different directions  Similarly French Italian Spanish Portuguese and Romanian were all originally Latinand the accents and dialects became totally different languagesxaxaMass communication like television and movies probably slows this process down a great deal'

p1
(lp2
S'Its the vapor trail it burns airline fuel like gasoline so it doesnt make that much smoke'
p3
aS'as the airplane zips through the air the air above the wing is caused to move faster than the air below thus creating lift  this depressurization also causes the air to be able to hold less water than before  So the water comes out of suspension and turns into a cloud  This also happens with helicopters but the downwash mixes the air so much that the vapor goes from cloud to bigger heavier water drops  Not quite rain but not quite cloudxaxaHappy trails'
p4
aS'Contrails are caused by water in the exhaust of jet engines and then freezing in the upper atmosphere  Its basically the same thing as a cirrus cloud  High performance airplanes can make white trails off their wingtips or on top of their wings which is caused by low pressure which in turn reduces the amount of water that is naturally in the air that the air can hold and it forms a cloud  An interesting side note is that long contrails  high relative humidity short contrails  low realitve humidity'

p3
aS'We cant really plug the whole  We can however reduce our usage of chemicals chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs that are enlarging the holexaxaOur usage has been decreasing and many studies suggest that while complete recovery is still very far off the ozone layer is making a comeback  Our usage of CFCs has not been entirely eliminated however developing countries are still permitted to use it  As the chemical becomes entirely phased out the ozone hole will recover more quickly'
