p3
aS'tapping on the glass is harmful to the fish it can cause stress to them some fish will follow your finger on the glass but not by tapping on it just genly placing yoru hand on the tank and moving it around the tank to have fish follow you isnt harmful but tapping on it to get them to move is'

p12
aS'NO  Fish have an organ on their bodies called the lateral line  This organ is very sensetive to vibration  Combine that with the fact that sound transfers quickly and intensely through the glass and water straightto the fish  A light tap to you will sound like a thunderclap to them AT best it scares them a loud tap can even cause them pain so dont do it'

S'wondering if i should tip for restaurant take out orders'
p1
(lp2
S'Tis depends on the service you recieve while waiting for your food or the service provided over the phone while ordering As a bartender in a small barHamburger joint we do not encourage take out However we will if asked As there are only two people on at a time I serve as well as bartend To answer the phones for a take out order is a pain and if they have to wait for an order I usually offer a soda while they wait Little things like this may prompt you to offer a gratuity'

aS'NO'
p5
aS'Nah'
p6
aS'Yes At least  They not only take your order they expedite your food package it and make sure everything is right If they are polite friendly and helpful by all means     TIP '
p7
aS'NO  If you tipped for take out orders just because they took your order your money and handed you a bag of food you would be tipping for what they already get paid for  Tipping is SUPPOSED to be for extra good service at least in my book not for just normal service  While I DO tip in sit down restaurants I dont feel it should be expected  Tips SHOULD be for extra good service What nexttipping cashiers at the grocery store for ringing up your order'
p8
aS'I dont think it is expected or necessary but it is nice On the other hand anyone who doesnt tip a standard  of their bill at a sitdown full service restaurant should simply not eat out Many people dont realize that while most bartenders get paid  or  an hour or more most waitresses are paid LESS than minimum wage a seperate minimum wage set aside for tipped employees usually about hr in most states more in some but none that Ive worked in If you cant afford a tip stay home'
p9
aS'No definately not'
p10
aS'nope'
p11
aS'I say yes Its like going to a deli or coffe shop and throwing a buck or two into the tip jar being a former employee of a coffee shop and having moved onto other things i always throw a few dollars in there and i alway add a few bucks onto a take out order it a few bucks to you but to them a few buck from every customer is a good amount of money'
p12
aS'I say yes  Somebody still has to do the work to put your order together  I wouldnt tip as much as I would for table service but cmon a buck or two wont kill you  At many restaurants the bar staff has to handle takeout orders  Friends who have worked as bartenders tell me it really sucks to be taken away from your bar customers to do takeout orders and then not get tipped when people pick up their food  Have a heart'

p3
aS'The Musical Potty worked for usxaThere is instant feedback and incentive for going in the appropriate place Also we tried to time potty training for the warmer months when they could wear big boy underwear outside without the fear of an accident on the carpet Plus boys generally find an emergency pee behind the tree quite funnyxaxaWe also limited pullups to nighttime use because the kids still viewed them as a diaper'
p4
aS'I have  kids including  boys who were initially resistant to using the potty  I swear by the method taught in Toilet Training in Less Than a Day by Nathan Azrin  It worked for both kids  as soon as they were ready  And it worked after other methods of toilet teaching failed  Also there were very few accidents afterwards'
p5
aS'Try a potty chart xaEverytime he goes on the toilet let him pick out a sticker and put it on his own potty chart You could even let him help you make it Thats how I got my daughter trained at night And pullups are a waste of money and they allow a child to think its okay to have accidents'

S'I am  years old can I love some one  years old without asking my parents'
p1
(lp2
S'Theres a reason why this is illegal  Whats a  yr old doing screwing around with a kid  I know you think youre grown up youre not  Also doesnt it raise some kind of red flag that you feel the need to hide this from your parents  Healthy relationships dont need to be hidden  Get away from this guy as soon as possible'
p3
aS'no its a very dangerous thing for someone at such a young age I was  thought I knew it all and was in love but time will help u dont do anythig stupid talk  ur mom she will understand and guide u'
p4
aS'Sweetie you can love anyone  The question is more along the lines of why  Ask yourself why you would want a relationship with someone six years older than you  Why would they want a relationship with someone six years younger  The difficulties with age difference decrease as people get older but as a young  person it is wise to not date someone who is nearly half your age older than you are  xaxaJust look for the reasons behind it  Be careful  Love'
p5
aS'no if you get pregnant by him that is called statutory rape he can go to jail and you are way to young to lose your virginity anyway'
p6
aS'As the person before me said your ability to love this person is not in questionxaAge is only a number but its going to be a meaningful number to your parents  If he really cares about you hell have to suck it up and introduce himselfxaxaIt may seem like a crappy option but its way WAY better than if you keep it a secret and they find out   years is a serious age difference when youre as young as you are'
p7
aS'AS A PARENT IM GOING TO GIVE YOU A PLAIN AND SIMPLE NO  I CANT SUGAR COAT THIS ANSWER FOR YOU'
p8
aS'well of course u can love that person nobody can say to u dont love him u cant counter what your heart says to u and u cant change your feelingsxabut i also think that u should tell it to you parent if that guy is your bf he should come to talk to you parent too it would be fine gesture'
p9
aS'No  First of all its wrong  Second its illegal  You are a minor and the other person is not  They can and should get in trouble for being involved with a minor  Once you yourself are  you will understand there is just too great a difference between being  and being   Trust that your parents want what is best for YOU  The year old wants what is best for HIM'
p10
aS'Assuming you are asking this in referrance to a romantic type of love I would say that you need to talk with your parents You may be having feelings that you dont understand because of your youthA  year old is probably looking for more from a relationship than what a  year old should be willing to offer It would be differrent if it was a  year old and a  year old You DO need to talk this over with your mom or dad'
